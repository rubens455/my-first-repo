# What's a Math Puzzle?

A math puzzle is a puzzle with a logical or a mathematical way to solve it, or find one of the many solutions to the puzzle. There are often multiple methods to finding the solution to a math puzzle, such as the brute force method.

# Puzzle I Like

I enjoy doing word puzzles, which are done when there are a bunch of random letters next to each other, formed in rows and columns, and you have to create words out of the letters next to each other diagonally or across from each other.
